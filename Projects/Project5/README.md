# Project 5 : 

**Goal :** Create a well-designed, well-documented software for EventBrite, an event management and ticketing website. The Event Manager from EventBrite, Bob, is the client who will be using your software to manage events and determine the revenue from events.

**Objectives :**
Your software should allow Bob to use an object of the `EventManagement` class to schedule events, and importantly, calculate the expected profit from different events hosted by EventBrite. Bob has no knowledge of the Event class therefore he should not call any method of the Event classes directly.
