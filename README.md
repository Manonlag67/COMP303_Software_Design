# COMP303_Software_Design :

Course taken in Winter 2020 taught by Professor Jin Guo at McGill University. 

### Description :

This course provides an in-depth introduction to the discipline of software design for building realistic and high-quality software applications. It will focus on object-oriented programming techniques, and cover topics related to managing software complexity and verifying that they work as expected. It will use Java for all the code examples and assignments. However, the considerations during the design process apply in all languages for practical software development.

### Expected Outcome :

After completing this course successful students should be able to:

Properly explain and apply general Design Principles (separation of concerns, encapsulation, substitutability, interface segregation, etc.) and important Design patterns;
Properly explain and apply design techniques such as UML Diagrams and Design by Contract;
Effective use programming language mechanisms such as exception handling and reflection;
Analyze and evaluate the quality of design solutions; correctly identify design smells and apply appropriate refactoring to eliminate them;
Gain experience on software development tools such as modern IDEs, automatic documentation and testing tools, and version control system.
